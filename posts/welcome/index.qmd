This is the first post to document how to setup this blog and to get familiar with the Quarto engine.

I'm following the quarto documentation here: [Quarto](https://quarto.org/docs/guide/) more specifically the [Creating a Blog](https://quarto.org/docs/websites/website-blog.html) guide. 

## Setup

First, I installed the package in RStudio: `install.packages("quarto")`
Then, in RStudio, I created a new project using the Quarto template. We need to reopen Rstudio after installing quarto for the option to become visible. Then I selected: `File > New Project > Quarto Blog`. 

## Publish
